## uploading

There are few ways to upload code to the module. One way is to use serial, but, in my opinion, using [WebREPL](https://github.com/micropython/webrepl) is easiest. 

To use WebREPL, You need to:

1. be at the same network as Your device
    * PC and device coul be connected to router
    * device could be an access point, PC could be connected to it
2. run webrepl webapp on the PC
3. pass device's IP address
4. log in to the device with Your password
5. easy send and receive files with dialogs, also You have working REPL!
